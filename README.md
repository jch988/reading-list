# reading-list
Creates a reading list in a particular order based on series and publication date

I want to read all of Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere books in order, but I don't want to burn out by reading them back-to-back.
I also want to read the Expanse books in order, but not back to back, for the same reason.
There are non-Cosmere, non-Expanse on the shelf to read as well. We'll call these 'Other'

Cosmere book
Other book
Expanse book
Other book
...repeat until there are no more Cosmere books

I help me find an appropriate reading order for these criteria, I wrote the Pyhton code here.

This is one of the two reasons I started learning Python in the first place.
It is a work in progress, and exists mostly so I could practice writing real-world code after learning the basics.
